## Description 
This application generates an employee role (Manager, Engineer, Intern), via command line interface. The required fields for all the positions are name, id, email, however, it does get role specific. For manager, it requires office number. For an intern it requires the school and for an engineer, it requires the GitHub user name. 

## User Story
```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```
